# eestv_lib

The reusable library part of my personal eestv project. Designed as a submodule with no extra dependencies for external usage. 

This is a lightweight submodule that's supposed to be fast to check out and doesn't add much size to the super-project.
As a trade-off, this project doesn't compile on it's own! The superproject must take care of it's dependencies. 

This project is developed as part of a super-project, with unit-tests and all of its dependencies taken care of. You can find it here:
